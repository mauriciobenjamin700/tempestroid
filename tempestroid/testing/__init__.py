"""tempestroid.testing — a Playwright-style UI test driver for the native IR.

The driver automates an app the way Playwright automates a web page, but against
the framework's **renderer-agnostic IR** rather than a DOM: it mounts an app,
locates nodes by stable key / visible text / accessibility semantics, injects the
same typed events a real tap or keystroke produces, and asserts the resulting UI
state — with **auto-wait** built into every action and assertion (the tree must
settle before proceeding; no fixed sleeps), so timing flake disappears.

Because every backend speaks the same IR + typed-event vocabulary, one test
script runs against every target. Two backends ship today: the **headless**
backend (:class:`HeadlessBackend`) drives the
:class:`~tempestroid.core.state.App`/IR/event core in-process with no renderer,
exercising the full ``event → handler → state → rebuild → diff → patch`` loop
deterministically; the **emulator** backend (:class:`EmulatorBackend`) drives a
REAL app through the **Compose** renderer on an Android emulator over the dev-
server harness bridge, and :class:`EmulatorPool` runs N isolated emulators in
parallel. The :class:`Page`/:class:`Locator`/assertion surface is identical
across targets, so **the same test runs headless and on the emulator** — only the
handler resolution differs (headless → callable, emulator → token).

Public surface:

* :class:`Page` — the top-level driver (locators, actions, auto-waiting asserts).
* :class:`Locator` — a lazy, late-resolving node query.
* :class:`TestBackend` — the protocol a renderer target implements.
* :class:`HeadlessBackend` — the no-renderer reference backend.
* :class:`EmulatorBackend` — drives a real Compose render on an emulator/device.
* :class:`EmulatorPool` — allocate/recycle N isolated emulators for parallel runs.
* :func:`run_test_file` — load + run a UI test file's ``test_*`` functions.
* :func:`run_test_files_emulator` — shard files across emulator serials.
* :mod:`tempestroid.testing.mirror` — host-side scene mirror (deserialize +
  apply patches), re-exported here as :func:`deserialize_scene` /
  :func:`apply_patches`.

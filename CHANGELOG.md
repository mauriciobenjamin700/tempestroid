# Changelog

All notable changes to **tempestroid** are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Overlay + gestures.** New **`Stack`** widget (z-order overlay; children share
  one box, `position=ABSOLUTE` anchors by `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` insets,
  others align by **`StackAlign`**) and **`GestureDetector`** (wraps a child,
  reports gestures via **`TapHandler`** / **`LongPressHandler`** / **`SwipeHandler`**:
  `on_tap` / `on_double_tap` / `on_long_press` / `on_swipe`). Adds the
  **`LongPressEvent`** / **`SwipeEvent`** (+ **`SwipeDirection`**) typed events and
  the **`Position`** style enum. Realized in the Qt renderer; the Compose device
  cases ship next.
- **Device screen-size presets (`tempestroid.devices`).** **`Device`** — an enum
  of logical (dp) viewport sizes for common phones (Pixel, Galaxy, Redmi, Poco,
  …) with `.size`; **`DEFAULT_DEVICE`** sizes the simulator window so it matches a
  real device instead of a generic guess.
- **`tempest install` — install the prebuilt host on a device (no SDK/NDK).**
  Resolves the host APK from an explicit `.apk`/URL → `TEMPESTROID_HOST_APK` → a
  bundled asset (in source checkouts) → a download from the matching GitHub
  release (`TEMPESTROID_HOST_APK_URL` override), cached under `~/.cache/tempestroid`.
  After installing once, `tempest serve` pushes app code over LAN.
- **`tempest new .` scaffolds in place, fully configured.** Writes `app.py`,
  `pyproject.toml` (with the `tempestroid[qt]` dependency and a `[tool.tempest] app`
  pointer), `README.md` and `.gitignore`. `.` (the default) targets the current
  directory; a name creates a subdirectory.
- **No-argument app commands.** `tempest dev` / `serve` / `build` / `run` read the
  app path from `[tool.tempest] app` in the nearest `pyproject.toml` when no path
  is passed, so inside a project the commands take no arguments.
- **`tempest serve` closes the device loop.** With a device connected it now
  auto-wires `adb reverse` and launches the host in dev mode pointed at the dev
  server (`--no-launch` to serve only).

### Changed

- **CLI migrated to Typer** — global `--version`/`-V` flag plus a `version`
  command, `no_args_is_help`, richer help.
- **`tempest build` fails with an actionable hint from an installed wheel** —
  when the `android-host` source tree is absent, the error points at the
  `tempest install` + `tempest serve` device path.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Composite component set expanded.** App shell primitives now include
  `AppBar`, `Scaffold`, `NavBar`, `Sidebar`, `Footer`, `Header`, `SafeArea`,
  `Menu`, `Drawer`, `Calendar`, `Clock`, `Card`, `Selection`, `Field`,
  `Feedback`, `Disclosure`, and navigation-focused widgets.
- **Native capability layer.** The Python↔Kotlin bridge now covers
  geolocation, sharing, camera, file storage, clipboard, Bluetooth scan, and
  the request/response native envelope.
- **CLI and device workflow polish.** `tempest build` / `tempest run` became
  more transparent, and the repository now includes a dedicated WSL device-run
  guide for USB/IP + `adb` mirroring.
- **Example and docs refresh.** The gallery and supporting docs were updated
  alongside the new component and device flows.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-31

First public release. The framework (Trilho A) is complete and the Android
runtime (Trilho B, phases B0–B6) is validated on a real arm64 device.

### Added

- **Typed declarative UI core.** A frozen-Pydantic `Style` model (`Color`,
  `Edge`, `Border`, `Transition`, and the style enums) and a widget IR
  (`Widget`, `Text`, `Button`, `Column`, `Row`, `Container`, plus value-bearing
  inputs and utility widgets).
- **Renderer-agnostic reconciler** — `build → diff → patch` (`Insert` / `Remove`
  / `Update` / `Reorder` / `Replace`).
- **Qt desktop simulator** (`run_qt`, optional `qt` extra) with a `Style → Qt`
  translator and an asyncio×Qt event loop via `qasync`.
- **Async-first state runtime** (`App`) with coalesced rebuilds and **stateful
  hot reload** (`App.swap_view`).
- **`tempest` CLI** — `dev` (simulator + hot reload/restart cockpit), `serve`
  (LAN code-push to a device), `spec` (typed contract as JSON), `new` (scaffold
  a project), `build` (bundle an app into an APK), `run` (build + install +
  logcat).
- **Android runtime (Trilho B).** Official CPython 3.14 (PEP 738) embedded via a
  hand-rolled JNI bridge in a Kotlin/Gradle host; native wheels (`pydantic-core`)
  via cibuildwheel; a Jetpack Compose renderer; a LAN dev server with QR pairing;
  and native capabilities (notifications).
- **Conformance suite** pinning the Qt and Compose `Style` translators with
  golden snapshots (phase D).

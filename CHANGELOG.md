# Changelog

All notable changes to **tempestroid** are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Composite component set expanded.** App shell primitives now include
  `AppBar`, `Scaffold`, `NavBar`, `Sidebar`, `Footer`, `Header`, `SafeArea`,
  `Menu`, `Drawer`, `Calendar`, `Clock`, `Card`, `Selection`, `Field`,
  `Feedback`, `Disclosure`, and navigation-focused widgets.
- **Native capability layer.** The Python↔Kotlin bridge now covers
  geolocation, sharing, camera, file storage, clipboard, Bluetooth scan, and
  the request/response native envelope.
- **CLI and device workflow polish.** `tempest build` / `tempest run` became
  more transparent, and the repository now includes a dedicated WSL device-run
  guide for USB/IP + `adb` mirroring.
- **Example and docs refresh.** The gallery and supporting docs were updated
  alongside the new component and device flows.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-31

First public release. The framework (Trilho A) is complete and the Android
runtime (Trilho B, phases B0–B6) is validated on a real arm64 device.

### Added

- **Typed declarative UI core.** A frozen-Pydantic `Style` model (`Color`,
  `Edge`, `Border`, `Transition`, and the style enums) and a widget IR
  (`Widget`, `Text`, `Button`, `Column`, `Row`, `Container`, plus value-bearing
  inputs and utility widgets).
- **Renderer-agnostic reconciler** — `build → diff → patch` (`Insert` / `Remove`
  / `Update` / `Reorder` / `Replace`).
- **Qt desktop simulator** (`run_qt`, optional `qt` extra) with a `Style → Qt`
  translator and an asyncio×Qt event loop via `qasync`.
- **Async-first state runtime** (`App`) with coalesced rebuilds and **stateful
  hot reload** (`App.swap_view`).
- **`tempest` CLI** — `dev` (simulator + hot reload/restart cockpit), `serve`
  (LAN code-push to a device), `spec` (typed contract as JSON), `new` (scaffold
  a project), `build` (bundle an app into an APK), `run` (build + install +
  logcat).
- **Android runtime (Trilho B).** Official CPython 3.14 (PEP 738) embedded via a
  hand-rolled JNI bridge in a Kotlin/Gradle host; native wheels (`pydantic-core`)
  via cibuildwheel; a Jetpack Compose renderer; a LAN dev server with QR pairing;
  and native capabilities (notifications).
- **Conformance suite** pinning the Qt and Compose `Style` translators with
  golden snapshots (phase D).
